**Software configuration:**

The code developed in “colouredFCGR” is in Python programming language version 3.9.

To compile the software correctly, installation of the following python libraries is required: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, keras, and tensorflow.

Also required are the main python packages for scientific computing (numpy), modules for implementing container data types (collections), asynchronous function execution (ProcessPoolExecutor) and image module (Pillow).

It is recommended to use in binary package manager such as conda, anconda or miniconda to create a system-level environment independent of the machine's operating system.
